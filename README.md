Welcome to the Commons Platform Co-Creation Group!

Who are we?
We are a diverse community of people with a range of skills, coming together to create the Commons Platform:


What is the Commons Platform?
A secure, open source, decentralised,commons-owned social network for community organising, activism, resource-sharing, crowd-sourcing, open access research, education and data, independent media, ethical commerce and a new economy.

What?!
Put more simply: 
“Get stuff done together that works better for everyone. 
Use, make and share things that help everyone. 
Build a world you want to be part of. 
By everyone, for everyone.”

How is this different from other social networks, organisational software or platforms?
The Commons Platform is like a social network but it is built by its members, it is private and secure, your data will never be sold and there will be no advertising, and it enables people to collaborate on building solutions to local and global problems.
Where it differs from existing organisational software is that it is actually building a community, where all of the tools that people develop become part of the network, are interoperable and are available for anyone else to use.
It enables people to create platforms for anything from tool-sharing or ride-sharing to alternative economics, but it is different from other platforms like Uber because all of the money generated is owned by the collective rather than extracted by corporations.
Essentially it enables everyone to disrupt the disruptors and keep money in local economies, and reduces the need for costly intermediaries like banks etc.
Existing platforms often use the motto ‘move fast and break things’. The Commons Platform enables people to collaborate to ‘move collectively and fix things.’

But don’t worry we’re not doing all of that immediately!


What we are working on now:
Our current phase is to identify what kind of world we want to create together within the network, establishing this within our community first so that it can be designed into every aspect of the platform itself:

A world based on meeting the needs of people and planet, not profit
Where everyone is safe to be who they are
based on consent not coercion.

We feel that by creating a culture of safety, accessibility and consent we can foster the conditions for creativity, collaboration and innovation.
A large part of this is about centering the needs of those marginalised by current systems, and creating spaces and ways of working that are safe for those who are currently most vulnerable.


Our Values
The values we developed together are: 
Safety, Ease, Commons ownership, All people and contributions valued, trust, collaboration, commitment to positive social change.


How do we work?
We are co-creating each stage of the project through a series of workshops, conversations, and collaborations with existing groups. 
We aim to make each part of this process as accessible as possible and are open to any feedback or suggestions.
Now that we have a larger group with members around the world we are also starting to hold Skype/Zoom group calls where people can join and create with us.
We have also set up a number of working groups to work on different aspects of the project.


Next steps:
See: Roadmap



How can you get involved?
We have identified our next series of workshops
, and also created a number of working groups to work on the next stages of the project: (See link)
Please indicate any that you are interested in.
The next step is to get in contact and let us know what your skills and interests are. 
Then you can join one of our weekly/fortnightly group calls to find out more about how we work and how we create safety within the group.
After that we can introduce you to a working group that is working on an area you are interested in. If there isn’t a group that takes your interest, but you have something you think would benefit the aims of the platform please get in touch and we can talk about creating one.


What do we need?
People! We love people who are interested in our common goals, who want to work together collaboratively for a world that works better for everyone.
All skills are valuable from software development to community building, economics to emotional support, copywriting to cryptocurrencies. Just let us know and we can put you in touch with other people who you can collaborate with.
If you have spaces we can use, or web hosting, or any other things we might need please do let us know.
