# Community Guidelines

We ask anyone who joins us to read and agree to Mozilla's [Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/)

During the Global Sprint we will be workshopping our own community guidelines for the Commons Platform so please feel free to comment if you would like to contribute thoughts about guidelines that have worked for you in other communities.

We may be able to provide a Zoom link to join the workshop on 10th May 2018 at approx 12pm London time UTC+1.
See [Event page](https://ti.to/Mozilla/global-sprint-london-redmond) for updated information
