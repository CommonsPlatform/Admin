# Welcome!

Come and build a new social media platform for community and collaboration, based on values, built by everyone for everyone and owned by everyone! 

There are lots of ways you can get involved 

First please familiarise yourself with the [Community Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) 

Next, check the 'issues' tab to find out what you can do now or on the days of the Sprint.  

By filling in this [questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeaDg6CV0myC6aJbnTUVojtLu5lsjuITKqcJE-JtMcdkhLazg/viewform)  you will be helping us to identify the main needs or problems, and start to work towards collective solutions 

We will be running workshops during the Sprint at the Redmond Community Centre 
The first day will be Discovery: shared values and community agreements, and identifying needs of individuals and communities 
The second day will be Design and Develop: Identifying the collective journey, what kind of platform meets the varied needs, what features it should have, how to make it accessible to a diverse community, and finally fun with prototyping. 

If you would like to join these workshops remotely, we aim to post video conferencing links on the [event page](https://ti.to/Mozilla/global-sprint-london-redmond/en) Please bear with us on this as it may not be possible but we will do our best!

We aim to add more issues. Any suggestions welcomed!
